# NeonCROSS 

This source code is the artifact of the paper *"[NeonCROSS: Vectorized Implementation of Post-Quantum Signature CROSS on Cortex-A72 and Apple M3](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/12676)"* (IACR TCHES Vol. 2026 No. 1).  

The reference implementation used is based on [CROSS version 2.2](https://github.com/CROSS-signature/CROSS-implementation).

## Overview

There are five subfolders included in this repository:

+ ref: A reference implementation of the signature CROSS. The required NIST API is present in ref/include/api.h.
+ neon: Neon-optimized implementation for key operations in CROSS.
+ test: Provides CMake-based build facilities to generate executable files that either perform a benchmark of the CROSS implementation or run unit tests. The main CMakeLists.txt file is located in the top-level directory.
+ KAT_Generation: Provides Cmake-based building facilities to generate the Known Answer Test files in the KAT folder. 
+ KAT: The directory contains a set of requests/responses to the Known Answer Tests, obtainable with the code present in KAT_Generation. The  digests of all the files are provided in the sha_512_sum_KATs file, and can be verified as: sha512sum -c sha_512_sum_KATs
  
## System Requirements

**Apple M3**  

+ Tested on MacBook Air with M3 SoC  

+ Recommended toolchain:  clang 19.1.3  

**ARM Cortex-A72**  

+ Tested on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with ARM Cortex-A72 @ 1.5GHz.  
- Recommended host toolchain: aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc 10.5. Direct compilation on Cortex-A72 is possible, but requires manual adjustment of compiler options in CMakeLists.  
- KAT tests involve OpenSSL; compiling on Cortex-A72 with gcc 10.5 is recommended.

## Test and Benchmarking

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ../ -DREFERENCE=3    # build with Neon optimization
# cmake ../ -DREFERENCE=1  # alternatively, build reference implementation
make
./bin/CROSS_test_*
sudo ./bin/CROSS_benchmark_*
```
Note:

Each binary is named based on the combination of category, underlying problem, and algorithm variant. For example:

+ CROSS_test_cat_1_RSDPG_SIG_SIZE: unit test for category 1, RSDPG, small variant.
+ CROSS_benchmark_cat_3_RSDP_BALANCED: benchmark for category 3, RSDP, balanced variant.

Choose the binary corresponding to the parameters you want to test or benchmark.

## KAT Generation and Verification
```bash
cd KAT_Generation
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ../ -DREFERENCE=3    # build with Neon optimization
# cmake ../ -DREFERENCE=1  # alternatively, build reference implementation
make
cd ..
chmod +x gen_all_kat.sh  
./gen_all_kat.sh
cd ../KAT
sha512sum -c sha_512_sum_KATs
```
